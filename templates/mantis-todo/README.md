# Mantis Todo Example

✨ **This Nx workspace has been generated by [Mantis, your passport to a seamless full-stack project launch.](https://github.com/futurizeworld/mantis-cli)** ✨

## Getting started

1. Install dependencies

   - Run `npm install` to install all dependencies

2. (Optional) Create a remote mongo instance

   - You will need a remote mongo instance set up to deploy this project, but a local instance will be created for you for development if you set `MONGODB_URI='local'` in the `.env.local` file mentioned below.
   - If you don't already have a Mongo db instance you can use, follow the steps to [set up an instance with MongoDB Atlas (it's free)](https://www.mongodb.com/docs/atlas/getting-started/).

   1. Create a config file in `apps/web-client` called `.env.local` i.e. `apps/web-client/.env.local`.
   2. Place your mongo connection string in that file as the following environment variable

      ```shell
      # Example
      MONGODB_URI='mongodb+srv://<user>:<password>@<cluster-name>.mongodb.net/?retryWrites=true&w=majority'
      ```

> To learn more about how Nx loads environment variables, see [Definte Environment Variables](https://nx.dev/recipes/tips-n-tricks/define-environment-variables#define-environment-variables)

## Start the web app

To start the development servers run `npx nx run-many --target=serve --projects=web-client,mobile-client`. Open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:4200/` to see the web app and `http://localhost:4300/` for the mobile app. Happy coding!

## Storybook

To start storybook for a client run `npx nx run <client>:storybook`.

For the web client, run `npx nx run web-client:storybook`, open your browser, and navigate to `http://localhost:5200`.
For the mobile client, run `npx nx run mobile-client:storybook`, open your browser, and navigate to `http://localhost:5300`.

## Testing

To run all of the unit tests, run `npx nx run-many --all --target=test`.

To run all of the unit tests with coverage, run `npx nx run-many --all --target=test --codeCoverage`. The coverage reports will be generated in the `coverage` folder at the root of this repo. You can view the reports in your browser by running `npx serve coverage/apps`.

To run all of the e2e tests, run `npx nx run-many --all --target=e2e`.

## Linting

To lint all projects, run `npx nx run-many --all --target=lint`.

## Format

To format all files, run `npx nx format:check --all`.

## Generating code

This repo comes with some Nx plugins that can be leveraged to help you generate boilerplate.

Run `nx list` to get a list of available plugins and whether they have generators. Then run `nx list <plugin-name>` to see what generators are available.

Learn more about [Nx generators on the docs](https://nx.dev/plugin-features/use-code-generators).

## Running tasks

To execute tasks with Nx use the following syntax:

```bash
nx <target> <project> <...options>
```

You can also run multiple targets:

```bash
nx run-many -t <target1> <target2>
```

..or add `-p` to filter specific projects

```bash
nx run-many -t <target1> <target2> -p <proj1> <proj2>
```

Targets can be defined in the `package.json` or `projects.json`. Learn more [in the docs](https://nx.dev/core-features/run-tasks).

## Want better Editor Integration?
