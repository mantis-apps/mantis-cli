# Mantis Todo Example

✨ **This Nx workspace has been generated by [Mantis, your passport to a seamless full-stack project launch.](https://github.com/mantis-apps/mantis-cli)** ✨

## Getting started

1. Install dependencies

   - Run `npm install` to install all dependencies

2. Choose your mongo instance

   - Option 1: Use a local instance

     - A local instance can be created for you if you run `npx nx run web-client:start-local-db` and will remain running for as long as that command hasn't exited.
     - To connect to it, follow these steps.

       1. Create a config file in `apps/web-client` called `.env.local` i.e. `apps/web-client/.env.local`.
       2. Place your mongo connection string in that file as the following environment variable.

          ```shell
          MONGODB_URI='mongodb://127.0.0.1:27017'
          ```

       3. Whenever you start the `web-client` ensure you run `npx nx run web-client:start-local-db` also (example in [Start the apps](#start-the-apps)).

   - Option 2: Use a remote instance

     - You will need a remote mongo instance set up to deploy this project so this will need to be considered regardless.
     - If you don't already have a Mongo db instance you can use, follow the steps to [set up an instance with MongoDB Atlas (it's free)](https://www.mongodb.com/docs/atlas/getting-started/).
     - Once you have a connection string, follow these steps.

       1. Create a config file in `apps/web-client` called `.env.local` i.e. `apps/web-client/.env.local`.
       2. Place your mongo connection string in that file as the following environment variable.

          ```shell
          MONGODB_URI='<the connection string>'
          ```

## Start the apps

To start the full stack locally with a local db, run `npx nx run-many --targets=serve,start-local-db --projects=web-client,mobile-client`.

To start the full stack locally without a local db, run `npx nx run-many --targets=serve --projects=web-client,mobile-client`.

Open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:4200/` to see the web app and `http://localhost:4300/` for the mobile app. Happy coding!

## Storybook

To start storybook for a client run `npx nx run <client>:storybook`.

For the web client, run `npx nx run web-client:storybook`, open your browser, and navigate to `http://localhost:5200`.
For the mobile client, run `npx nx run mobile-client:storybook`, open your browser, and navigate to `http://localhost:5300`.

## Testing

To run all of the unit tests, run `npx nx run-many --all --target=test`.

To run all of the unit tests with coverage, run `npx nx run-many --all --target=test --codeCoverage`. The coverage reports will be generated in the `coverage` folder at the root of this repo. You can view the reports in your browser by running `npx serve coverage/apps`.

To run all of the e2e tests, run `npx nx run-many --all --target=e2e`.

## Linting

To lint all projects, run `npx nx run-many --all --target=lint --verbose`.

## Format

To format all files, run `npx nx format:check --all`.

## Generating code

This repo comes with some Nx plugins that can be leveraged to help you generate boilerplate.

Run `nx list` to get a list of available plugins and whether they have generators. Then run `nx list <plugin-name>` to see what generators are available.

Learn more about [Nx generators on the docs](https://nx.dev/plugin-features/use-code-generators).

## Running tasks

To execute tasks with Nx use the following syntax:

```bash
nx <target> <project> <...options>
```

You can also run multiple targets:

```bash
nx run-many -t <target1> <target2>
```

..or add `-p` to filter specific projects

```bash
nx run-many -t <target1> <target2> -p <proj1> <proj2>
```

Targets can be defined in the `package.json` or `projects.json`. Learn more [in the docs](https://nx.dev/core-features/run-tasks).

## Want better Editor Integration?

Open this repo in [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) and install the recommended extensions.
